# opensudoku
This fork of the original [opensudoku](https://github.com/romario333/opensudoku) was created as the original has not been updated in 2 years.

The plan is to update the project structure and add required gradle files so that the project will build with Androids newer SDK build-tools (v21.1.2) and Android Studio (v1.0.1). 

The app will also be updated to support Android 5.0.1 (API 21)
