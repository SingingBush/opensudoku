==========

Initially created by Roman Masek in Feb 2009.

This fork of the original [opensudoku](https://github.com/romario333/opensudoku) was created as the original has not been updated since 2012.

The project has been updated to target Android 5.0.1 (API 21) and builds with the SDK build-tools (v23.0.3) and Android Studio (v1.5.1).
