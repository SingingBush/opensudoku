This fork of the original [opensudoku](https://github.com/romario333/opensudoku) was created with the intention of keeping the codebase working with more recent versions of the Android API's and build tools.

The project structure has been updated to build with Gradle (the default for Android Studio projects) and now targets API 21 (Android 5.0.1).
